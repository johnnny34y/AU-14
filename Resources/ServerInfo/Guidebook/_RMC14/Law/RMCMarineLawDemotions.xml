  # Demotions

  ## General Procedure
  - A person who has been demoted is moved to a lower position, or if no such position exists, a rifleman.
  - Demotions are limited to crimes where demotion is explicitly listed as an option.
  - The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] may turn any demotion to a termination instead, making the person a civilian. A [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] does not have this permission.

  ## Riflemen Procedure
  - Riflemen who are demoted are to be discharged and treated as civilians.
  - Their access to equipment should be restricted as such.
