  ## This is an English community.
  - Speaking full sentences in anything but english is disallowed. Sneaking in single words or phrases in other languages is allowed so long as it compliments your RP (your character referring to their "padre", "amigo", etc is fine).

  ## Why
  We are not currently recruiting staff fluent in other languages to moderate them. Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game.

  ## Non-English Options
  There are many servers that allow or focus on other languages. You are highly encouraged to play on servers that allow languages you are fluent in for the best experience.
