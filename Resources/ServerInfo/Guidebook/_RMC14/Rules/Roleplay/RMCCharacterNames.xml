  # Character Names

  [italic]Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the discord.[/italic]

  ## Use realistic names, avoid names of real people and characters
  - Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name.
  - No names or references of people or characters from the real world.
  - No titles/ranks/honorifics. Titles, ranks and honorifics include but are not limited to; Dr/Doctor, Jr/Junior, Major.
  - Names must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names.
  - Up to three characters of Roman numerals may be used in the place of a nickname.

  ## Nicknames
  - They may be used in the format of, in single quotes, [bold]Firstname 'Nickname' Lastname[/bold].
  - Nicknames can be at most two words.

  ## Artificial Womb Soldiers
  [italic]These soldiers do not have any biological parents who have passed along their last name to them. Instead these soldiers have been assigned a regular first name, the AW initials as a middle name and a weapon as their surname.[/italic]
  - As an AW Soldier you MUST have a weapon as your last name.
  - The last name selected may not contain any numerical or hyphenated portions. For example; AA-12 would not be an acceptable last name but Javelin would.
  - This weapon needs to have been used/developed before or during 2012 or earlier. (Vulcan, Sword, etc.)
  - For example; James AW Vulcan
